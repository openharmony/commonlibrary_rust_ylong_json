# ylong_json

## Introduction
`ylong_json` is a general `JSON` syntax parsing library that provides functions for converting `JSON` text to and from specific data structures.

The following is a description of the key fields in the above figure:
- `Application Layer`: The application layer provides specific functions to users.
- `App`: Various applications need to use the functions of the system service layer.
- `System Service Layer`: System service layer, which provides system services to upper-layer applications.
- `system services`: Various system services require the use of `JSON` related functions.
- `ylong_json`: System component, providing common `JSON` serialization and deserialization capabilities to related components of the system service layer.
- `serde`: third-party library for efficient and versatile serialization and deserialization of `Rust` data structures.

`ylong_json` is mainly divided into three submodules: `JsonValue` submodule, `serde` submodule, and C-ffi submodule.

The `JsonValue` submodule provides a basic data structure `JsonValue`.
`JsonValue` supports serializing itself into `JSON` text in either indented or compact format. Any syntactically correct `JSON` text can also be deserialized into a corresponding `JsonValue` data structure.
`JsonValue` supports addition, deletion, modification and query, and you can use the specified interface to change the data content in `JsonValue`.
`JsonValue` supports all data types in `JSON` syntax: `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `array`, `object`, and implements all its functions according to `ECMA-404`.
For `array` and `object` grammatical structures, `JsonValue` provides a variety of underlying data structures for different usage scenarios, for example, for `array` structures, it supports the underlying use of `Vec` or `LinkedList`, for `object` , supports the use of `Vec`, `LinkedList` or `Btree` as its underlying layer.
On different underlying data structures, `array` and `object` will reflect different creation and query performance, for example, `object` based on `Btree` data structure has higher performance in query, `LinkedList` or `LinkedList` or `Vec` has high performance in terms of creation.

The `serde` submodule provides procedural macro functions based on the `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits provided by the `serde` third-party library, which can support fast conversion of user structures and `JSON` text.
The advantage of `serde` compared to `JsonValue` is that it is easy to use. Users do not need to convert the `JSON` text to `JsonValue` and then extract the specified data from it to generate the `Rust` structure. They only need to set `Serialize' to the structure. ` and `Deserialize` process macro tags can be used to serialize the interface structure provided in `ylong_json` into `JSON` text, or convert the corresponding `JSON` text into a user structure.

The C-ffi module provides a C interface layer based on the `JsonValue` module, which facilitates users to use the C interface to call the functions of the `ylong_json` library.

## Build
### Use Cargo 
1. Add `ylong_json` to the dependency of `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
ylong_json = { git = "https://gitcode.com/openharmony-sig/commonlibrary_rust_ylong_json.git" }
```

### Use gn
1. Add `ylong_json` in `bundle.json`
```gn 
“deps”： {
    “components”: ["ylong_json"]
}
```

2. Add `ylong_json:lib` in `BUILD.gn`
```gn 
external_deps = ["ylong_json:lib"]
```

## Performance test
The following tests are from [`nativejson-benchmark`](https://www.github.com/miloyip/nativejson-benchmark)。

The test environment information is as follows:
```
OS: Ubuntu 7.3.-16ubuntu3
Processor: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6278C CPU @ 2.60GHz
CPU(s): 8
Memory：8.0 G
```

Software versions tested:

cJSON 1.7.16

twitter.json           210 MB/s   210 MB/s
```

Description of test results:

Three test files are provided in the `nativejson-benchmark` test. Among them, `canada.json` contains a large number of `number` structures, the various data types of `citm_catalog.json` are relatively average, and `twitter.json` exists Various `UTF-8` characters.
To ensure test fairness, `ylong_json` enables `list_object`, `list_array` and `ascii_only` feature.
The `list_object` and `list_array` features are mainly to ensure consistency with the `cJSON` data structure, and both are implemented using linked lists.
`ascii_only` feature is to ensure consistent processing logic for `UTF-8` characters, `cJSON` does not handle UTF-8 characters.

The testing process is as follows:
- Read the content of the file into the memory, and get the content of the file `content`.
- Call the specified `JSON` library deserialization interface to generate the corresponding `JSON` structure `data`.
- Call the serialization interface of the `JSON` structure to generate the output content `result`.
- Using `content`, loop deserialization generates `JSON` structure 100 times, taking the smallest processing time `t1`.
- Using `data`, serialize and generate `JSON` text 100 times, taking the smallest processing time `t2`.
- Calculate the parsing speed, the deserialization time is the length of `content` divided by `t1`, and the serialization time is the length of the `JSON` text divided by `t2`.
